        <h1>Tianna Coburn</h1>
        <p>My name is Tianna, and I'm an engineer with a passion for data analytics. I have a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Oregon State University (go beavs), and as a PNW native I am obligated to spend much of my freetime outdoors enjoying the outdoors :). Please use the banner to navigate around the website, and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Thanks!</p>
