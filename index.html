        <a href="/tcoburn/aboutme.html">About Me</a>
        <p>My name is Tianna, and I'm an engineer with a passion for data analytics. I have a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Oregon State University (go beavs), and as a PNW native I am obligated to spend much of my freetime outdoors enjoying the outdoors :). Please use the banner to navigate around the website, and please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. </p>
        <p>My intent of this website is twofold: 1) to share information about myself and my work more easily, and 2) to learn and become more comfortable with html, css, and git. As such to the latter, this website will be in development for quite a while as I discover and implement better UI & UX features. So, thank you in advance for coming along for the ride with me :)</p>
