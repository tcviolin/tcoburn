        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Born in Vietnam, I call Oregon home. I grew up in the Portland area, and it was there where I fell in love with chemistry during my high school chemistry class. I searched Google for jobs related to chemistry and math, and there it was: chemcial engineering. Perfect. With great job stability, opportunities to positively impact society, and career flexibility, chemical engineering seemed like the perfect field. One campus visit and a few generous scholarships later, and I found myself committing to Oregon State University.</p>
        <p>I'll spare you my resume details (which you can find here!) in favor of my hobbies, of which there are many.</p> 
        <p>When I was 2 years old (I don't remember this, but my mom tells the story often), I saw a violinist on TV, and told her "I will play that one day!" I started out on piano at 4, with my oldest sister as my instructor, but when I was 7 I finally (!) got a violin rental and began violin lessons. I currently play as a first violin with the Hillsboro Symphony Orchestra, and although I do not regularly play piano anymore, I still enjoy trying out the occasional pop song. I also sporadically maintain a sheet music blog, which I started when I was 13 because I was frustrated I couldn't find free sheet music for a particulr song I wanted to play. I took up running in college to help me feel control in life after my dad passed away from multiple sclerosis, and haven't looked back except when I trip and need to see if anyone saw. My favorite distance is a half marathon, although I once ran a full marathon so I could put the 26.2 bumper sticker on my car. I enjoy both trail and road running, for different reasons, but my ankles enjoy road running more. I also took up cider homebrewing in 2022, and enjoy making artisanal local small batch gluten free vegan non gmo cider. If the batch turns out well, I invite friends over to try some. if the batch turns out sour, I invite friends over to lessen my own ingestion. And lastly, I love reading, and right now I'm on a memoir binge. Here is a list of some of my favorite books - if you try any out, let me know what you think :)</p>
