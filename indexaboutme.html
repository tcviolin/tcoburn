        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Born in Vietnam, I call Oregon home. I grew up in the Portland area, and it was there where I fell in love with chemistry during my high school chemistry class. I searched Google for jobs related to chemistry and math, and there it was: chemcial engineering. Perfect. With great job stability, opportunities to positively impact society, and career flexibility, chemical engineering seemed like the perfect field. One campus visit and a few generous scholarships later, and I found myself committing to Oregon State University.</p>
        <p>I'll spare you my resume details (which you can find here!) in favor of my hobbies, of which there are many.</p> 
        <p>1. Music: When I was 2 years old (I don't remember this, but my mom tells the story often), I saw a violinist on TV, and told her "I will play that one day!" I started out on piano at 4, with my oldest sister as my instructor, but when I was 7 I finally (!) got a violin rental and began violin lessons. I currently play as a first violin with the Hillsboro Symphony Orchestra, and although I do not regularly play piano anymore, I still enjoy trying out the occasional pop song. I also sporadically maintain a sheet music blog, which I started when I was 13 because I was frustrated I couldn't find free sheet music for a particulr song I wanted to play. </p>
        <p>2. Running: I started regularly running in college to help me feel control in life after my dad passed away from multiple sclerosis, and haven't looked back. My favorite distance is a half marathon, although I once ran a full marathon so I could put the 26.2 bumper sticker on my car. I enjoy both trail and road running, for different reasons, but my ankles enjoy road running more. </p>
        <p>3. Brewing: I took up cider homebrewing in 2022, and enjoy making artisanal local small batch gluten free vegan non gmo cider. If the batch turns out well, I invite friends over to try some. if the batch turns out sour, I invite friends over to lessen my own ingestion. </p> 
        <p>4. Reading: Right now I'm on a memoir binge. Here is a list of some of my favorite books - if you try any out, let me know what you think :)</p>
        <p>5. Cycling: This is not actually a hobby. I just bike to work because I hate traffic >:(</p>
        <p>6. Coffee: Make no mistake, I am no coffee connoisseur. I am a solidly average coffee enjoyer. But oh do I relish in being a solidly average coffee enjoyer. I love trying out different shops in which to eavesdrop or read a book, and thankfully Portland is plentiful when it comes to coffee joints! If I am feeling unadventerous, my regular is a 12oz vanilla latte (in a ceramic cup if possible).</p>
        <p>7. Cans: Collecting cans is not just a favorite pastime, but it is also a favorite presentime. It's free money, my friends don't want to recycle the cans themselves, and I guess this is my side hustle, if you will. I have a technique for depositing the cans as quickly as possible, and I see it as a science. </p>
        <p>8. Food: I'm a big foodie on a smaller budget ($10-20). I post to my foodstagram (foodie instagram) regularly on my latest and greatest ventures, and what made that dish so delectable. I'm especially a sucker for spicy food, so if you don't like spicy food, I'm sorry that your life is boring. Korean, Thai, Viet, Cambodian, and Laotian are my top 5 favorite cuisinal cultures, but I'm a big fan of Mexcian food, too!</p>
